        <p class="t-body article__body">
            Balancing your hormones - Exercise can assist to balance your hormones by increasing endorphins while decreasing estrogen and insulin.
            Improving your mood - Due to hormone imbalances and PCOS symptoms, people with PCOS may be more susceptible to depression. Exercise regularly releases endorphins (happy hormones).
            Aiding weight loss - When you have PCOS, trying to lose weight might be discouraging. You can lose weight by engaging in daily exercise that you love and following a healthy eating regimen.
            Improving your sleep quality - Exercise can promote restful sleep. Snoring, sleep apnea, and other issues are more common in those with PCOS. Obesity also exacerbates these issues.
            Reducing your risk of diabetes - Aerobic activity can enhance insulin sensitivity which can help in reducing the risk of diabetes.
            Helping to manage cholesterol - Women with PCOS are more likely to have elevated cholesterol, which can be decreased with exercise and a good diet.
            Lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases - High blood pressure and cardiovascular disease are both more likely in you. Your heart's health will improve with exercise.

        <h2 class="t-copy-large article__section-heading">Types of Exercise for PCOS symptoms:</h2>
        <p class="t-body article__body">
            The key advantages are outlined in more detail below, along with other helpful exercises for PCOS:
            <li>Walking:
                Many individuals don't realize how efficient walking is. But one of the simplest and healthiest methods to move your body and improve general well-being is to walk. It is free and has almost no unfavorable side effects. Walking can increase stress resilience by lowering stress hormones, reducing inflammation, increasing endorphins (the brain's feel-good chemicals), and boosting endorphin levels. This can suppress testosterone production and support your adrenal glands. Research demonstrates that walking, especially after eating, has significant advantages for blood sugar and can help lower blood sugar levels by enhancing insulin sensitivity and is one of the best exercises for PCOS sufferers.</li>
            <li>Cardio: 
                Running, swimming, uphill trekking, rowing, and cycling are examples of cardio workouts that increase heart rate. Cardio exercises come in a variety of intensities. Moderate cardio workouts include advantages such as enhancing cholesterol levels, brain function, blood sugar control, sleep quality, and mood.</li>
            <li>Strength training:
                Weights, resistance bands, or your body weight are frequently used in strength training exercises, which concentrate on developing muscle. Similar to cardio, there are different levels of intensity for strength training, as well as advantages and disadvantages, depending on how you do it. Numerous advantages of moderate strength exercise include improved blood pressure, lowered blood pressure, support for metabolic function, and stronger bones.</li>
            <li>Yoga:
                While holding various positions, yoga comprises moderate movements that concentrate on stretching, balancing, and mild toning. According to a short study on women with PCOS, those who practiced yoga for an hour, three times a week, saw significant drops in their levels of free testosterone and DHEA as well as improvements in their levels of anxiety, sadness, and menstrual cycle management.  </li>
            <li>Core Strength:
                Using your body weight, resistance bands, or weights during strength training helps you gain muscle. Resistance training was found to be more successful than other forms of exercise at lowering the Free Androgen Index (testosterone levels) in women with PCOS, according to research on the various exercise therapies for PCOS. Strength exercise at both "vigorous" and "moderate" levels produced beneficial effects, and the more frequently you did it, the better. Simple activities like push-ups and tricep dips strengthen the upper body, enhance insulin sensitivity, and continue to burn calories even after the session is over.</li>

        </p>
        <h2 class="t-copy-large article__section-heading">Effects of Exercise on PCOS:</h2>
        <p class="t-body article__body">
            Changing your lifestyle for the better is essential for managing PCOS. Two of the most effective methods to do that are through diet and exercise, and both must be addressed for these lifestyle changes to be successful. For women with PCOS, regular exercise has amazing advantages that go far beyond weight loss.
            <li>Enhances Insulin Sensitivity 
Studies have shown that regular cardio and strength training can help your body respond to insulin more effectively, reducing your risk for diabetes and other issues.</li>

<li>Lowers Cholesterol 
High triglycerides and cholesterol are more common in PCOS-affected women. The metabolic syndrome, which is more common in PCOS-affected individuals, can also be exacerbated by this. When paired with a healthy, low-fat diet, exercise can help lower cholesterol.</li>

<li> Endorphins 
Depression symptoms are more likely to appear in PCOS women. Your body releases endorphins during exercise, which are hormones that foster emotions of well-being. You can manage your stress better and lessen some depressive symptoms by doing this.</li>


<li>Better Sleep
Regular exercise can help you sleep better and fall asleep more quickly. Sleep apnea, snoring, and even insomnia are more common in women with PCOS. See if regular exercise‚Äîjust not right before bed‚Äîcan improve your ability to sleep at night. </li>

<li>Hormone Regulation
Your body uses the fat that is already stored in your body as fuel when you burn more calories than you consume. Of course, doing this aids in weight loss and insulin reduction. In addition, having too much fat affects the way estrogen is produced in your body. Getting rid of some of those additional fat deposits will help regulate your hormones and, ideally, PCOS.</li>

The following advice can be helpful if you're unsure of how to start establishing or changing your fitness regimen:

Concentrate on the motions you find enjoyable. Exercise ought to be enjoyable! Find what makes you happy by spending time investigating various choices.
Organize and rank it. In the same way, you would reserve time for an appointment or other commitments.
Keep an open mind. The context, as always, is everything. Be prepared to adjust your training regimen as necessary and keep aspects like sleep, stress, nutrition, etc. in mind at all times.
There is no ideal workout regimen, and each person's exercise program will be slightly different. In the end, we aim to develop a movement regimen that is supportive of PCOS recovery and whole-body health. This is continuously evaluating the situation and using your body's response to make adjustments.
